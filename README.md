# 📊 Amazon Sales Analytics — End-to-End Data Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project delivers a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — transforming raw Amazon sales data into actionable business insights using **Python** and **Power BI**.

The objective was to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario where stakeholders require clear visibility into sales performance, fulfillment efficiency, customer behavior, and revenue drivers.

👉 The dataset contains **128,000+ transactions** across multiple product categories, cities, and fulfillment channels.

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Process

Real-world datasets are messy — this project focused heavily on production-level data preparation.

Key steps performed:

✔ Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns  
✔ Handled missing values intelligently  
✔ Standardized categorical fields  
✔ Created time-based features (Year, Month, Day)  
✔ Flagged imputed currency and amount values  
✔ Engineered promotion indicators  
✔ Validated data types  

👉 Result: A **high-quality analytics-ready dataset** suitable for BI tools.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to identify patterns before dashboard development.

### Major Analytical Areas:
- Sales distribution
- Category performance
- Fulfillment analysis
- Promotion impact
- Geographic trends
- Order status breakdown
- Temporal sales patterns

### Example Insights:
✅ Majority of orders were successfully shipped, but cancellations represented a measurable revenue risk.  
✅ Certain categories consistently outperformed others, indicating strong product-market fit.  
✅ Promotional orders showed higher conversion but require margin analysis.  
✅ Sales displayed clear monthly seasonality — useful for demand forecasting.
